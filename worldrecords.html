                <p class="intro-text">Randy Gardner is the current world record holder of the scientifically documented record for the longest period of time a human has gone without sleep. He stayed awake for a little over 11 straight days.</p>
                <p class="intro-text">Throughout the experiment Gardner was observed by researchers from Stanford University, who noted serious cognitive and behavioral changes including moodiness, problems with concentration, short term memory loss and paranoia.</p>
                <p class="intro-text">Interestingly enough - and in sharp contrast to Peter Tripp - Gardner did not appear to suffer any long term psychological or physical damage from his attempt.</p>

                    <p class="intro-text">Not all who embark on quests of sleep deprivation are as fortunate as Randy Gardner, take Jiang Xiaoshan, a more recent example. In 2012, he too went 11 days without sleep, in an attempt to watch every game being broadcast during the European Soccer Championships.</p>
                    <p class="intro-text">Beyond just staying up for this astonishing amount of time, Xiaoshan also drank and smoked heavily throughout the period, only compounding upon his pre-existing health conditions. After his 11th straight day of wake, Xiaoshan finally went to bed - and subsequently died in his sleep just a few hours later.</p>

                <p class="intro-text">Peter Tripp was a New York DJ who managed to stay awake for 8 days in a "wakeathon" for charity. As a fairly normal and well adjusted man prior to this, doctors decided to observe him throughout the length of his record breaking attempt to see if any noticeable change would come from it.</p>
                <p class="intro-text">By day four of his attempt, Tripp began suffering from delusions and hallucinations. At times his delusions were so severe that it was near impossible to measure his psychological functions.</p>
                <p class="intro-text">Ultimately, Tripp was able to break the world record - and subsequently fell asleep for 22 hours straight as soon as he had. However things didn't return back to normal for him, in fact he continued to suffer from psychotic problems for years to come. Tripp lost his friends, wife, job, and was last seen selling books door-to-door in the Midwest.</p>
